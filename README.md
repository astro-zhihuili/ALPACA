ALPACA: Absorption Line Profiles Arising from Clumpy Absorbers (Li et al. 2023)

<img src="Alpaca.jpg" height="315">

ALPACA is a fast and easy to use semi-analytic forward model for metal absorption lines emerging from a clumpy galactic environment.

A joint fitting of down-the-barrel spectrum and EW v.s. b profile can be performed via: python3 joint_fitting.py
